      devices is growing every year, there will always be a high demand for programmers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics stated 
      that within this decade, computer programming jobs would mostly be available to those outside the United States. This due 
      to the fact that companies are considering employing people all around the world since they would pay them lower wages.</p>
    <p>However, jobs such as software developing, web developing, computer system analysts, and others show a good career outlook
      for the next 10 years. Their estimated growth is from 9% and up to 21% for software development jobs.</p></div>

    <div class="cntnt">When we use the computer, we interact with it through mouse and keyboard, but we don't really stop and think about the 
      program running in the background. Programming will get you familiar with the software, programs, devices, and websites and 
      will help you understand them. Due to this familiarization, you will grasp and adopt new technology tools much more quickly.
