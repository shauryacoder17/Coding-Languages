    <div class="newhdng-java">Introduction:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-java">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as 
      few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write 
      once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need 
      to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless 
      of the underlying computer architecture.</div>
    <br><br>  
    <div class="newhdng-java">Data types:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-java">Java has two categories in which data types are segregated: 
      <br><br>
      1) Primitive Data Type: such as boolean, char, int, short, byte, long, float, and double
      <br>
      2) Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="newhdng-java">Principles:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-java">There were five primary goals in the creation of the Java language:
      <br>
      <ol>
        <li>It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.</li>
        <li>It must be robust and secure.</li>
        <li>It must be architecture-neutral and portable.</li>
        <li>It must execute with high performance.</li>
        <li>It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.</li>
      </ol>  
    </div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="newhdng-java">Syntax:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-java">The syntax of Java is largely influenced by C++ and C. Unlike C++, which combines the syntax for 
      structured, generic, and object-oriented programming, Java was built almost exclusively as an object-oriented language. 
      Java uses comments similar to those of C++. There are three different styles of comments: a single line style marked with 
      two slashes (//), a multiple line style opened with /* and closed with */, and the Javadoc commenting style opened with /** 
      and closed with */.
    </div>
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="newhdng-java">Conclusion:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-java">If you are looking for being a programmer then Java can be the best choice for you. As it is the most 
      commonly used programming language in the world, According to Oracle, 3 billion devices run on Java. Java is a mature 
      language and there is a big community on the internet, means any problem you'd face in Java already have an answer 
      somewhere on the internet. So if you want to be a andriod app developer, java is worth learning and if you want
      to get the resources for learning it, click on the "Sources" button on the navigation bar.
