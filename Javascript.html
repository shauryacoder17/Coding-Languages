    <div class="newhdng-js">Introduction:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-js">JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 
      As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated 
      JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</div>
    <br><br><br>  
    <div class="newhdng-js">Libraries and Framework:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-js">Over 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting. 'jQuery' is by far the most popular library, 
      used by over 75% of websites. Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. 
      Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others. In contrast, the term 
      "Vanilla JS" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.</div>
    <br><br><br>
    <div class="newhdng-js">Weakly typed:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-js">JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.
      <ul>
        <li>The binary '+' operator casts both operands to a string unless both operands are numbers.</li>
        <li>The binary '-' operator always casts both operands to a number.</li>
        <li>Both unary operators (+, -) always cast the operand to a number.</li>
      </ul>
      Values are cast to strings like the following:
      <ul>
        <li>Strings are left as-is</li>
        <li>Numbers are converted to their string representation</li>
        <li>Arrays have their elements cast to strings after which they are joined by commas (,)</li>
        <li>Other objects are converted to the string [object Object] where Object is the name of the constructor of the object.</li>
      </ul>
      Values are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining toString and valueOf functions on 
      the prototype for string and number casting respectively. JavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules 
      can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when 
      subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.

    <div class="newhdng-js">Conclusion:</div>
    <br><br>
    <div class="cntnt-js">The use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for 
      server-side website deployments and non-browser applications. Initial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's 
      Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other 
      approaches. Electron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other 
      non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript. JavaScript has recently begun to 
      appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.
