    <div class="cntnt-about">
      Hello there, I am Divyansh Bansal, a 13-year-old student. I have an elder sister who is in grade 12th. My hobbies are
      building websites and playing Lawn Tennis. In the beginning, I was learning Python but then I thought why not learn Html and create a website and use my python skills for back-end 
      development of the website. I was inspired by children of my age building apps and web pages. I had an interest in computers since I was eight years old. My favorite games 
      are Fortnite, Rocket League and, Apex Legends. I usually do not play games but if I want to, during my vacations, 
      I would definitely choose one of these.
